# list-animate

`list-animate` is a Haskell library that animates functions in [Data.List](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-List.html).

Users can either view pre-rendered animations, or open the included terminal app and enter the function and arguments they want animated live.

`list-animate` is built using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), and uses [Reanimate](https://reanimate.github.io/) to create animations and [Brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick) for the interactive terminal app.

## Instructions

This library is still under development. To try out the interactive TUI app, clone this repository, open GHCi inside the repository, and enter `Main.main`.
